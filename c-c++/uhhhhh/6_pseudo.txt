Define a structure 'student' with:
    - long int id
    - int year_in_college
    - array of 4 double test_scores

Initialize an array 'student_list' of 5 'student' structures with given values.

Define constants:
    n_students = 5
    n_tests = 4

Define function 'show_student_average' with parameter 's' (of type 'student'):
    Initialize 'student_average' to 0
    For each test score in 's.test_scores':
        Add the score to 'student_average'
    Divide 'student_average' by 'n_tests' to get the average
    Print 's.id' and 'student_average'

Define function 'show_test_average' with parameter 's' (array of 'student'):
    Initialize an array 'tests' of size 4 to 0
    For each student in 's':
        For each test score in the student:
            Add the score to the corresponding 'tests' element
    For each test in 'tests':
        Calculate the average by dividing by 'n_students'
        Print the test number and the average

Define function 'main':
    Print header "ID  Average Test Score"
    For each student in 'student_list':
        Call 'show_student_average' with the student
    Print a newline
    Print header "Test Average Score"
    Call 'show_test_average' with 'student_list'
    Return 0
