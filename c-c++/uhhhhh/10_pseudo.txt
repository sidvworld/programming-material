	Declare choice as integer.
	Declare factor and dot as double.
	Declare result, v1, and v2 as vec2d.

Main

    Do:
	Display Menu: Print "1) Add vectors; 2) Scale vector; 3) Dot product; 4) Exit: ".
	Read user input into choice.
	Process User Choice:

	If choice is 1:
		Print "Enter vector 1 (x, y): ".
		Read v1.x and v1.y.
		Print "Enter vector 2 (x, y): ".
		Read v2.x and v2.y.
		Call add(v1, v2) and store the result in result.
		Print "Result: " and call display_vector(result).

	If choice is 2:
		Print "Enter vector (x, y): ".
		Read v1.x and v1.y.
		Print "Enter scaling factor: ".
		Read factor.
		Call scale(v1, factor) and store the result in result.
		Print "Result: " and call display_vector(result).

	If choice is 3:
		Print "Enter vector 1 (x, y): ".
		Read v1.x and v1.y.
		Print "Enter vector 2 (x, y): ".
		Read v2.x and v2.y.
		Call dot_product(v1, v2) and store the result in dot.
		Print "Result: " followed by the value of dot.
	
	If choice is 4:
		Print "Bye!".

	Default:
		Print "Error!".

	While choice != 4
