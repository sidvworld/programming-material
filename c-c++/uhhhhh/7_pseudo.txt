Define max_lines as 1000
Define max_char as 2000

Declare text as a 2D character array with dimensions max_lines and max_char
Declare lines as an integer, initialized to 0
Declare frequency as an integer array of size 26, initialized to zeros

Declare loop as a boolean, initialized to true

Output "Input lines of text. Press ENTER on blank line when finished."

Do:
    Read a line of text into text[lines] using fgets
    If text[lines][0] is '\n' or '\r':
        Set loop to false
        // Count frequencies of each letter in the input lines
        For each line from 0 to lines-1:
            For each character in text[line]:
                Set character to the uppercase of text[line][character] using toupper
                If character is alphabetic (isalpha(character)):
                    Subtract 'A' from character to get index in frequency array
                    Increment frequency[character]
    Else:
        Increment lines

While loop is true

// Output the frequencies of each letter
For each letter index from 0 to 25:
    Output the letter corresponding to 'A' + index and its frequency in frequency[index]
